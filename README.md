### TDBunk

Debunking misinformation and disinformation

1. Provide secure encypted storage of VCs
2. PFI discovery and crawling idenity hubs
3. Receiving, offering, and presenting VCs (End user consent will be required to offer VCs)
4. Applying digital signatures
5. Storing transaction history


To provide clarity on how KCCs function, many of the examples in this guide will refer to a user named Alice transacting via a fictional mobile application called Mobile Wallet. Mobile Wallet is a mobile application that individuals use to:


Purchase digital assets using fiat currency from PFIs on tbDEX.

Sell digital assets for fiat currency to a PFI on tbDEX.

Manage and secure their digital identity information. Mobile Wallet also acts as a self-custodial digital wallet for Identity information.

It creates a DID for the user and securely stores the private keys for that DID directly on-device.

It stores Verifiable Credentials issued to the user directly on-device.



⚠️ Note: While our example focuses on a Mobile Wallet capable of purchasing, storing, and selling digital assets, KCCs may generally be used for any type of financial transaction.


To transact with PFIs on tbDEX, Alice first opens Mobile Wallet and searches for PFIs offering services of interest to her. Alice sees a handful of PFIs offering the service she wants in her region, each of which requires Alice present a Verifiable Credential to access the service. Alice settles on one PFI, which has positive reviews and offers competitively priced services.
